Chekov (Rails edition)
============

A lightweight, Rails-backed web app for minor bug tracking and resolution.

Ideal for quick-turnaround projects, or for issues to minor to be added to a more comprehensive issue tracker, 
or that can be disposed of in just one sitting, a few hours, or in one day. 

A simplified interface requires only the most basic facts.  Just close the ticket and check it off!
