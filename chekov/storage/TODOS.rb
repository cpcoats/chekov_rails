
 1. Edit Task
 		- anyone can edit tasks (and shouldnt we track this somewhere?)

 2.	Edit Comment
 		- only admins && commenter can edit comments
 		- only admins && commenter can delete comments
 		(^^ probably need a Permissions/RoleService or -Strategy for these too)

 3. task-stats: express as MetroUI-style, flat/matte-colored heatmap square?

 4.	make .meta icons darker (maybe opacity: 0.5?)
